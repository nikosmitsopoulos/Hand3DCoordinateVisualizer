# Hand 3D Coordinate Visualizer

This project implements real-time detection of the **right hand** using [MediaPipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/) and visualizes a **local 3D coordinate system** based on specific hand landmarks.

## Goal

The goal is to extract the position and orientation of the hand and display a 3D orthonormal coordinate frame directly on the detected hand using OpenCV and Matplotlib.
